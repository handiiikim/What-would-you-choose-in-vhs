    <h3> He replies, </h3>

  </div>
<h2>By applying so-called myth of ‘threats by North Korea,’ most use it to control the lower classes as well as the obedience to authority and unity spirit of the general public. It’s not really a confrontation. And, people have to be reminded about that. Conscientious objection first started in England during World War 1 and that was during an actual war, not just a confrontation. Still, those who wanted to refuse did what they had to do!</h2>

<h2>Just because conscientious objection is permitted, it’s not going to make 400,000 to 500,000 people, or even 100,000, no, not even 50,000 out of the 600,000 to try and refuse serving in the army.</h2>

  </div>
<h2>Yes. The focus is to recognise conscientious objection while cutting off the excuses to evade military service under the title of conscientious objection. To cut off those excuses, the duration of alternative service, types of service, quality, and details should be defined clearly, and then evasion of military service will no longer be an issue…!</h2>

South Korea is currently threatened by the military dictatorship of North Korea that functions based on a completely different political system.

  <h2>Hey! A myth? It’s really happening. Here is Korea, not England. or where else. Let’s try to be realistic. If everyone chooses the alternative service system instead of serving in the army, then everyone will end up leaving. So then, how can the military be sustained while 500,000 out of 650,000 are soldiers?</h2>

  </div>
  <h2>I agree on this objector’s idea. Not going to the army doesn’t mean that they will do nothing and just play.  It means that they will serve with alternative service that corresponds to military service. It   only involves not taking up arms. For example, if people do things that are related to the social net such as helping unfortunate children or volunteering in prison, then there is a very low risk for people to evade military service.</h2>
